The purpose of this program is to take a simple banking application
written in Java and translate it into Smalltalk.

The run file is executed with the command:
./run
and runs the gst command on the files in the correct order automatically.
Smalltalk being a purely object-orientated language was very different than languages I've used in the past.
It's syntax is also something that has been very difficult to get used to, and I still struggle with.
